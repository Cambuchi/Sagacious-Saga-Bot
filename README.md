# sagaciousSagaBot
A python script to automatically play Sagacious Saga using floodfill recursion strategy.
Dependant on pyautogui for color retrieval and screen checking for game region, buttons, and game over prompts.
Make sure you have the game open and visible in a browser at 100% zoom.

Here is the script in action. Note that pyautogui is slow at retrieving all of the colors. So improvement in speed can be achieved with buffering.
